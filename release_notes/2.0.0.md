# jasmine-browser-runner 2.0.0 Release Notes

This is a major release that includes breaking changes. Please see the
[Jasmine 5 migration guide](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/upgrading_to_Jasmine_5.0)
in addition to reading the list of changes below.

## Breaking changes

* jasmine-core peer dependency has been updated to 5.0.
* Dropped support for Node 12, 14, and 16
* Dropped support for Safari 14 and Firefox 91
* Backslashes in file globs (e.g. `spec_files`) are treated as escape characters
  on all platforms. Previously they were treated as directory separators on
  Windows and escape characters elsewhere.

## New features

* Made ES module file extension configurable
  * Fixes [#22](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/issues/22).
* Opt-in support for top-level-await in ES modules

  This can be enabled by adding enableTopLevelAwait: true to the configuration.
  It's off by default because HTTP requests for scripts are performed
  sequentially rather than potentially in parallel. This comes at a cost in
  performance but is the only way to ensure a stable order when randomization
  is disabled or a random seed is specified.

## Internal improvements

* Updated dev dependencies
* Removed leftover Safari <12 support code

## Supported environments

This version has been tested in the following environments.
